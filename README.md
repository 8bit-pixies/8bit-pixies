### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**chipmunk-pixel/chipmunk-pixel** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...
-->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on machine learning research in my spare time. I'm also looking at ways to improve machine learning inference in battle-tested production systems.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Golang, Kotlin and Rust
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything at all!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Simply @ me by raising an issue in [my personal repository](https://github.com/chipmunk-pixel/chipmunk-pixel/)
