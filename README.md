- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on machine learning research in my spare time. I'm also looking at ways to improve machine learning inference in battle-tested production systems.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Golang, Kotlin and Rust
    - [Decision Engine](https://github.com/8bit-pixies/decision-engine) with Rust and Python bindings
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Simply @ me by raising an issue in [my personal repository](https://github.com/chipmunk-pixel/chipmunk-pixel/)

<!-- **My research code:**

**My ML Algorithm implementations and/or tutorials:**

I am one of the original authors of [scikit-learn's category encoders](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/category_encoders)

- [Crank ML](https://github.com/chipmunk-pixel/crank-ml): What if scikit-learn was differentiable? Implementations of decision trees, linear models, decomposition, preprocessing all in pytorch
- [Scene Completion](https://github.com/8bit-pixies/Scene-Completion): An implementation of "Scene Completion Using Millions of Photographs"
- [Graph Differential Pooling](https://github.com/8bit-pixies/graph-differential-pooling): A short tutorial/implementation of graph differential pooling to understand how it works
- [Hoeffding Trees](https://github.com/8bit-pixies/Hoeffding-Trees): A minimal implemention of Hoeffding trees with visualizations to understand how they work
- [Feature Rich Encodings](https://github.com/8bit-pixies/feature-rich-encoding): An implementation of feature rich encodings for NLP applications

**My foray into parsers and compilers:**

- [Ramble](https://github.com/8bit-pixies/Ramble): A combinatory parser for the R programming language
- [Stan](https://github.com/8bit-pixies/Stan): A SAS transcompiler to Python for the SAS programming language
